# Outil d'Optimisation des Routes de Secours

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing an intelligent and dynamic route optimization system designed for emergency rescue operations during disaster scenarios. By leveraging real-time data, predictive analysis, and reinforcement learning, the system aims to minimize response times, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure the safety of rescue teams.

## Features
### Key Functionalities:
- **Dynamic Route Mapping:** Real-time cartographic updates for optimal navigation.
- **Predictive Traffic Analysis:** Anticipates and adapts to changing traffic conditions.
- **Multi-Vehicle and Team Management:** Supports the coordination of multiple rescue units.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Continuously learns from past experiences for better decision-making.

### Data Sources:
- Official road networks and GPS systems.
- Live traffic feeds and weather data.
- Emergency condition reports.

### Core AI Capabilities:
- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), Policy Gradient Methods.
- Frameworks: OpenAI Gym, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

## Architecture
### Backend:
- Python with Flask or Django.

### Frontend:
- React  for interactive dashboards and visualizations.

### Database:
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data.

### Real-Time Systems:
- Apache Kafka for live data integration and management.

### External Integrations:
- Mapping APIs: Google Maps, OpenStreetMap.
- Crisis management systems.
- Emergency communication protocols.
